  <h4>Aliens</h4>
  <p>In Block Gun 3D, there are different waves with different types of aliens. These are the enum values with the prefab names (in order from the code):</p>
  <p>ALIEN_BLUE (alienBlue)</p>
  <p>ALIEN_YELLOW (alienYellow)</p>
  <p>ALIEN_RED (alienRed)</p>
  <p>UFO (UFO Baby 1)</p>
  <p>ALIEN_BLACK (AlienBlack)</p>
  <p>DL5 (unknown)</p>
  <p>DL6 (unknown)</p><br>
  <p>The hardest (known) alien to kill is ALIEN_BLACK, being the biggest in size too.</p>
  <p>DL5 and DL6 are probably either placeholders or just a decompiler error.</p>

  <h4>Map</h4>
  <p>Normally, you cannot exit the map. With modding though, you can delete the invisible wall GameObject and go through.</p>
  <h4>Map: Houses</h4>
  <p>This map has 2 houses, both being the same. The first house, near where you spawn, has flowers at the front. The second house instead has no flowers.</p>
  <p>In every side of both houses there's a duplicated door texture. Here's the texture that appears in every side:</p>

  <h4>UFO Mother</h4>
  <p>UFO Mother is the GameObject name of the big UFO that you can see in the title screen and while playing.</p>
  <p>Seeing the UFO Mother while playing is harder, as the Y rotation limit isn't 90.</p>
  <p>The alien inside the UFO is the yellow alien, but bigger. The UFO Mother is basically a bigger version of the UFO enemy.</p>
